# Lets-learn-some-colors
(OpenCv Project)

Maybe to you and me BRICK RED and CRIMSON RED are all Reds but not for the geeks. Upload a photo and simply hover your mouse over it to learn the different colors. Make sure you have pandas and opencv installed alongside python.
Make sure to have the provided py and txt file in the same directory, hover to that directory where this files are stored and then run the commands below.

Run the python file using the command 
>python Color_names.py -i image-path

Replace image path with suitable path, let's say you stored img1 in F: Drive, run the command as
>python Color_names.py -i F:\img1.jpg
